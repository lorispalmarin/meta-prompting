In the mystical city of Evernight, where shadows whispered secrets and magic crackled in the air, there was a renowned detective known as Ember Lockwood. With piercing emerald eyes that seemed to see through lies and a cloak woven from threads of starlight, Ember was sought after to solve the most baffling of cases in the realm.

One moonlit evening, a desperate fairy named Lumi fluttered into Ember's office, her delicate wings trembling with fear.
