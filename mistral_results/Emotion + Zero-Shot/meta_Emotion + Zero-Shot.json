This quaint hamlet boasted the most vibrant gardens, the sweetest fruit orchards, and the kindest inhabitants. Yet beneath this peaceful veneer lurked a sinister secret. For unbeknownst to all but one, an insidious curse had claimed their joyous community.\nA spectral figure, shrouded by the crimson glow of the moonlit nights, prowled the quiet streets.
