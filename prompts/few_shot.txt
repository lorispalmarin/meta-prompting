Below are two examples of how to write creative fairy tales combining different genres:

Example 1: A cyberpunk-fantasy tale about a magical hacker who reprograms dreams in a neon-lit forest
Example 2: A noir-folklore story in which a cursed detective solves ghost crimes in a forgotten village.

Now, using the same creative format and narrative balance, write a new fairy tale based on the two genres provided by the user.

Blend the styles meaningfully and maintain the tone of a cohesive and well-written story."
