Here are two examples of good prompts for creative storytelling tasks:
	1.	Write a prompt that asks a language model to create a science fiction fable about a lonely AI in a medieval kingdom.
	2.	Write a prompt instructing a model to tell a detective story in the tone of a childrenâ€™s bedtime tale.
Now, write a new prompt asking for a fairy tale that combines two different narrative styles.
