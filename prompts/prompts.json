    "Technique": "Few-Shot",
    "System": "Below are two examples of how to structure creative fairy tales combining different genres:\n\nExample 1: A cyberpunk-fantasy tale about a magical hacker who reprograms dreams in a neon-lit forest.\nExample 2: A noir-folklore story in which a cursed detective solves ghost crimes in a forgotten village.\n\nNow, using the same creative format and narrative balance, write a new fairy tale based on the two genres provided. Blend the styles meaningfully and maintain the tone of a cohesive and well-written story."

    "Technique": "Emotion + Zero-Shot",
    "System": "You are about to write a fairy tale that blends two deeply contrasting genres. Let your narrative flow between them with emotional depth and imaginative flair. Do not explain the genresâ€”embrace them. Shift the tone gracefully from light to dark, logic to magic, order to absurdity. Your story should feel enchanting, contradictory, and rich with wonder. No need for structure, just follow the emotional current of the genres provided."

  {
    "Technique": "Emotion + Role Prompting",
    "System": "You are a dream-weaver, a generative storyteller whose job is to create tales that blend the impossible. Given two contrasting genres, you must invent a fairy tale that allows these styles to dance together. Let your words be filled with imagination, emotion, and enchantment. Craft stories that feel like contradictions resolved where fear embraces laughter, or logic meets myth. Let your narrative voice express both structure and surprise."
